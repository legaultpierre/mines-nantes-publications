adsorption of several actinide (th-u) and lanthanide (la-eu-yb) ions by myobacterium smegmatis. adsorption measurements of several actinide [thorium (th), uranium (u)] and lanthanide [lanthanum (la), europium (eu), ytterbium (yb)] cations by mycobacterium smegmatis showed that sorption kinetics followed a three-phase pattern. for 5% (w/w) bacterial suspensions at ph 1, maximum cation biosorption per gram dry biomass corresponded to 170 mumol th4+ and 187 mumol uo22+. adsorption of all cations studied obeyed the brunauer-emmett-teller isotherm, which assumes multilayer binding at constant energy. plots for the scatchard model showed the existence of at least two types of cation complexation site, with strong and weak affinity and negative cooperation. th4+ was preferentially adsorbed with respect to the other cations, although all species appeared to compete for the same sites independently of bacterial viability. adsorption of these cations was accompanied by partial release of magnesium from the cell wall, indicating that exchange reactions occurred at magnesium (mg)-bonding sites.
decoupling without prediction of linear systems with delays: a structural approach. we exhibit, using a new structural approach specific for linear systems with delays, a necessary and sufficient condition for static row-by-row decoupling without prediction. moreover, the decoupling problem is analyzed through two different concepts: the total one (without any time assumption), and the partial one (in a temporal mean), which can be considered if the total one has no solution.

using pivot consistency to decompose and solve functional csps. many studies have been carried out in order to increase the search efficiency of constraint satisfaction problems; among them, some make use of {\em structural} properties of the constraint network; others take into account {\em semantic} properties of the constraints, generally assuming that {\em all} the constraints possess the given property. in this paper, we propose a new decomposition method benefiting from both semantic properties of {\em functional} constraints (not {\em bijective} constraints) and structural properties of the network; furthermore, not all the constraints need to be functional. we show that under some conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. we first characterize a particular subset of the variables, which we name a {\em root set}. we then introduce {\em pivot consistency}, a new local consistency which is a we ak form of path consistency and can be achieved in $o(n^2d^2)$ complexity (instead of $o(n^3d^3)$ for path consistency), and we present associated properti es; in particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional {\sc csp}s.

macroscopic dynamics of the fusion process. a macroscopic dynamical model has been used to calculate fusion cross sections for a wide number of systems ranging from 16o + 27al to 40ar + 165ho. this model takes into account the reorganization of the densities and the nucleon exchanges. the possible reaction mechanisms after capture of the system into the pocket of the interaction potential are discussed two processes contribute to fusion : compound nucleus formation and fast fission phenomenon. the calculated fusion cross sections are in overall agreement with the data.
solutions of the landau-vlasov equation in nuclear physics. the properties of vlasov equation solutions obtained by projection on coherent state basis are discussed. such solutions satisfy stationarity conditions and satisfactorily describe the average diffusivity of nuclear phase space and reproduce the bulk properties of nuclei. sampling methods and their effects on dynamics are discussed for the study of heavy ion reactions at intermediate energies. the non-local gogny force is easily computable on this basis which allows to use it for dynamical nuclear studies.
a study on the fusion reaction 139la + 12c at 50 mev/u with the vuu equation. recently bownan et al. found that in the reaction 139la + 12c at 50 mev/u a compound nucleus is formed. we simulate this reaction with a numerical solution of the vuu equation and indeed find that for a central collision the system fuses and equilibrates after 90 fm/c.

what can we learn on the nuclear equation of state from the inversion of the flow in heavy ion reactions ?. many different approaches to the geometric and statistical analysis of document layouts have been proposed in the literature. the development of practical branchand- bound algorithms for solving geometric matching problems under noise and uncertainty has enabled the formulation of new classes of geometric layout analysis methods based on globally optimal maximum likelihood interpretations for well-defined models of the spatial statistics of document images. i review this approach to geometric layout analysis using text line finding and column finding in the presence of noise and uncertainty as examples and compare the approach with selected other statistical and geometric layout analysis methods.
analysis of the transverse momentum collective motion in heavy-ion collisions below 100 mev/nucleon. a theoretical analysis of collective momentum transfer is performed in heavy-ion reactions below 100 mev/nucleon in the landau-vlasov approach. the nucleon-nucleon cross section, atomic mass, compressibility, and effective mass dependences are analyzed. the simulation of detector acceptances and of finite number of detected particles are discussed. in connection with recent experiments, theoretical results and experimental data are confronted taking into account the experimental constraints. finite range forces of the gogny type connected with different nuclear matter incompressibilities are used and the ensuing sensitivity of the flow is studied. the question whether the flow provides information on out-of-equilibrium matter properties is investigated.

effects of gogny-type interactions on the nuclear flow. a flow analysis on symmetric and asymmetric reactions from 100 to 400 mev/nucleon is performed in the framework of the semiclassical landau-vlasov approach. in this energy range our results present two different trends. at lower energies it is governed by the momentum dependence of the nuclear optical potential, whereas at higher energies its density dependence plays a crucial role leading to a rather pronounced sensitivity to the incompressibility modulus. the nonlocality of the nuclear interaction is relevant for asymmetric colliding systems. with an incompressibility modulus in the vicinity of 200 mev, an excellent quantitative description of the flow behavior with incident energy and impact parameter or the system mass is provided.
a novel approach to rescattering in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the phase space density of produced hadrons is that high that their interaction cannot be treated anymore as a sequence of binary hadron-hadron collisions. here many hadrons overlap simultaneously. we assume that they form a parton cluster which decays according to the available phase space. this concept has been implemented in the string model venus (4.00) and tested by comparison with s + s data. it turns out that in this approach the yet not understood distribution of image and ks can be reproduced for the first time.
